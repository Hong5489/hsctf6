Help! I got this new lock for Christmas, but I've forgotten the first two values. I know the last value is hsctfissocoolwow. I also managed to grab a copy of their secret key generator. Can you help me out?

Note: submit the first two combo values separated by a space in hex format.
```
[generator.py](generator.py)

I explain only the `next()` and `h()` bacause others is not important

`m()` function reduce the size of number become 8 bytes (Because of & operator)

`h()` function is do some complicated calculation and put it to `s[0]` and `s[1]`

`next()` function is just running `h()` and return `m(b)`
```python
def m(a):
	return a&0xffffffffffffffff
def next():
	b = m(s[0]+s[1])
	h()
	return m(b)
def h():
	s1 = m(x(s[0],s[1]))
	s[0] = m(x(oro(o(s[0],55),p(55,s[0])),x(s1,(o(s1,14)))))
	s[1] = m(oro(o(s1,36),p(36,s1)))
```

`bin2chr` function is just binary to characters

`isp` function is just check whether the binary is printable (In ASCII range)
```python
# Helper methods
def bin2chr(data):
    result = ''
    while data:
        char = data & 0xff
        result += chr(char)
        data >>= 8
    return result

def isp(d):
	if all(c in ch for c in d):
		return d
	else:
		return d.encode('hex')
```
And the last part:
```python
# throw away first value for additional randomness
next()
next()

COMBO_NUM_1 = isp(bin2chr(next())) + isp(bin2chr(next()))
COMBO_NUM_2 = isp(bin2chr(next())) + isp(bin2chr(next()))
COMBO_NUM_3 = isp(bin2chr(next())) + isp(bin2chr(next()))

print "Thanks! Your numbers are: "
print COMBO_NUM_1
print COMBO_NUM_2
print COMBO_NUM_3
```
According to the description, it said the last value is `hsctfissocoolwow`

And tell us to recover first two combo values, which is `COMBO_NUM_1` and `COMBO_NUM_2` 

So we need to find the original `s[0]` and `s[1]` after calling `next()` 6 times and resulting the `COMBO_NUM_3` is `hsctfissocoolwow`

I used the popular **z3 solver** which can solve very complex maths algorithm

[Full script in python](solve.py)
```python
from z3 import *
solver = Solver()
s = [BitVec('s%i' % i, 128) for i in range(2)]	# Declare two binary value in size of 128
flag = 'hsctfissocoolwow'
flag1 = int(flag[:-8][::-1].encode('hex'),16)	# Convert first half into integer
flag2 = int(flag[8:][::-1].encode('hex'),16)	# Convert second half into integer

def o(x,k):			# Copied the functions in the generator.py
	return x<<k
...
...
...

next()		# Call next() 6 times
next()
next()
next()
next()
next()
solver.add(next() == flag1)		# Add condition in 7th next() is equal to first half
solver.add(next() == flag2)		# Add condition in 8th next() is equal to second half
print solver.check()			# Check is solvable
print solver.model()			# Print the result
```
## Result
```
sat
[s1 = 16423178736247365899, s0 = 81081519719372872192]
[Finished in 54.5s]
```
Completed in just 54 second

The result means the `SECRET_1` is 81081519719372872192 and `SECRET_2` is 16423178736247365899

We can just substitute inside `generator.py` and run it!

And the first two value is our flag!
